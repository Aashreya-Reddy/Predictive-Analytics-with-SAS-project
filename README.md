Sterling-Rice Group has been a flourishing marketing services company for more than 30 years, offering brand positioning, creation, architectures, mergers and acquisitions. The company serves customers ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies. The company has worked with several food and beverages giants including Starbucks, Kraft, and Coors.
The data provided is SRG’s quantitative research study conducted in 2015 to better understand health and wellness, and help their clients in any of the numerous ways – brand positioning, expanding market share of food and beverage companies, launching market strategies, etc. 

We helped their clients maximize their profits by increasing product sales. For this, we studied the given data to find the target audience would be the best way to maximize profits. Through clustering analysis, we determined a target audience and established a target profile. The target audience for the particular company is people who are “Aspiring Wellness” and “Epitomizing Wellness” and have BMI in the range 18.5 to 25. We termed the target as Healthy Eater. We also recorded the shopping preferences of the Healthy Eater like the store that they buy their groceries. This way the product can be featured or displayed in such stores to maximize profits. 
We also have to find out various factors about these people like the average age, average salary and education of each of these groups as that will help us take better and informed business decisions.
